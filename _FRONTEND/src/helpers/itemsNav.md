This code snippet defines a function called `getItemsNav` that takes in two parameters: `language` and `role`. 

The function filters an array called `i18n[language]` based on the value of the `role` parameter. If `role` is `null`, it filters the array for elements where the `role` property is equal to `'loggedout'`. If `role` is `'PATIENT'`, it filters the array for elements where the `role` property is equal to `'patient'`, `'both'`, or `'loggedout'`. If `role` is `'DOCTOR'`, it filters the array for elements where the `role` property is equal to `'doctor'`, `'both'`, or `'loggedout'`. Otherwise, it filters the array for elements where the `role` property is equal to `'none'`.

The filtered array is then mapped to extract the values of each element and flattened into a new array. The resulting array is returned.
