This code defines a function getPathRoutes (pathroutes.js:4-14:2) that retrieves a specific route based on the language and routeName parameters. It checks if the route is for the navigation bar or not using the isForNavBar parameter and then filters the routes accordingly from either i18nNav or i18nOtherRoutes object based on the language. If no routes are found, it returns false, otherwise, it returns the route.
