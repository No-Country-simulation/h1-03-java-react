Code Explanation:
This code snippet is a React functional component named FormSignup that is used to render a user signup form.

Import Statements:
The component uses two custom hooks, useNavigate and useSelector, to access navigation functionality and state management provided by react-router-dom and react-redux libraries.

Component Functionality:
The handleSubmit function is triggered when the form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission behavior.
The form structure includes multiple Input components for capturing user information such as name, last name, email, password, and repeat password.
There is a commented out Select component that allows users to select a role, which is not currently active in the form.
A Button component is used for form submission with signup text and styling.
A link is provided for users who already have an account to navigate to the sign-in page using the navigate function.

Internationalization (i18n):
The form content is dynamically rendered based on the selected language stored in the Redux state. Text and placeholders are retrieved from the i18n object according to the chosen language.

Note:
The onChangeHandler functions for the Input components are currently empty and need to be implemented to handle user input changes.
This component provides a structured layout for user signup with language-dependent content and navigation options within a React application.
