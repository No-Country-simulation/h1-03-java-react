Code Explanation:
This code defines a React component called RolePopup.

State Management:
It uses the useState hook to manage the closePopup state variable.
The useEffect hook is used to initialize the closePopup state to false.

Function Handlers:
onClickHandler: This function is triggered on a click event to set closePopup to true.
closePopupAndGoToHome: This function sets closePopup to true and navigates to the home page based on the selected language.

Component Structure:
The component returns a <section> element with dynamic styling based on the closePopup state.
Within the section, there is a <div> element that represents the popup content.
An <img> element functions as a close button within the popup.
A <p> element displays the title retrieved from the language settings.
A <form> element contains the Radio component for role selection.
A <Button> component is used for user interaction, with text and functionality based on the selected language.

Interaction:
Clicking on the section triggers the closePopupAndGoToHome function.
Clicking on the close button in the popup also triggers the closePopupAndGoToHome function.
This component manages a popup interface for selecting a role with localization support and navigation functionality.
