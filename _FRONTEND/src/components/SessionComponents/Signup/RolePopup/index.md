**RolePopup Component**

The `RolePopup` component is a React functional component that serves as a popup dialog for selecting a role. It takes a prop called `setRoleSelection` as an argument.

**Imports and Hooks**

- It imports the `useNavigate` and `useSelector` hooks from React Router and Redux, respectively.
- It also imports the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React.

**State Variables**

- It declares two state variables using the `useState` hook: `closePopup` and `isButtonDisabled`.

**Functions**

- The `getRoles` function maps over an array called `roleList` and extracts the `roleName` property.
- The `onClickButtonHandler` function updates the `closePopup` state variable.
- The `closePopupAndGoToHome` function updates the `closePopup` state variable and navigates to the home page.
- The `handleSubmit` function handles the form submission and updates the `roleSelection` prop.

**Rendering**

- The component renders a section with a fixed position and a black background.
- Inside the section, it renders a dialog box with a close button, a title, a form, and a submit button.
- The dialog box is centered on the screen and has a white background.
- The close button is positioned in the top right corner and has a click event handler to close the popup and navigate to the home page.
- The title is displayed in the center of the dialog box.
- The form contains radio buttons for selecting a role and a submit button.
- The radio buttons are rendered using the `Radio` component and receive various props.
- The submit button is disabled by default and becomes enabled when a role is selected.

Overall, the `RolePopup` component provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a role and submitting the form.
