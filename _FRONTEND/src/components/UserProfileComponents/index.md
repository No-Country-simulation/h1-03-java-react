Sure! Here's a more detailed and organized explanation of the code snippet, divided into sections with line breaks for better readability:

**UserProfileMainComponent**

This code snippet defines a React functional component called `UserProfileMainComponent`. It exports this component as the default export.

### Importing Dependencies

The component imports the following dependencies:

- `useSelector` from the `react-redux` library
- `useState` from the React library
- `useQuery` from the `react-query` library
- `useEffect` from the React library
- `endpoints` (assumed to be imported from a file)
- `getFetch` (assumed to be imported from a file)

### Accessing Redux Store Values

The component uses the `useSelector` hook to access the `language` and `role` values from the Redux store.

### Initializing State

The component uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state variable called `tempTypeUser` with the value `true`.

### Fetching Data

The component defines a `url` variable and retrieves the `token` from the `sessionStorage`.

It then uses the `useQuery` hook from the `react-query` library to make an asynchronous request to the `url` endpoint with the `token` as a parameter. The `useQuery` hook returns an object with various properties such as `data`, `error`, `isLoading`, `isFetching`, `isSuccess`, and `refetch`.

### Conditional Rendering and Effect Hook

The component uses the `useEffect` hook to conditionally call the `refetch` function when the `data` value changes and the `role` value is falsy.

### Rendering Components

The component renders different components based on the value of the `role` variable. If the `role` is "PATIENT", it renders the `EditMyInfoPatients` component. If the `role` is "DOCTOR", it renders the `EditMyInfoDoctors` component. Otherwise, it renders an empty fragment.

Finally, if the `role` value is truthy, it renders the `DeleteAccount` component.

Overall, this component is responsible for rendering different components based on the user's role and managing the asynchronous request to the `url` endpoint.
