This code snippet is a React functional component called `EditMyInfoPatients`. It is exported as the default export. 

The component uses various hooks from the `react-query` library, such as `useQuery`, `useState`, and `useEffect`. It also uses the `useSelector` hook from the `react-redux` library to access the `language` value from the Redux store.

The component fetches data from two different endpoints using the `useQuery` hook. It also manages the state of `entriesData` and `isPostInsteadOfPut` using the `useState` hook.

The component renders a form with various input fields and a submit button. The form is conditionally rendered based on the `data` value.

When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmitPatientForm` function is called. It prevents the default form submission behavior, retrieves the form data, and sets the `entriesData` state.

There are two `useEffect` hooks in the component. The first one is triggered when the component mounts and fetches the user and patient information. The second one is triggered when the `entriesData` state changes and performs a POST or PUT request based on the `isPostInsteadOfPut` state.

Overall, this code snippet represents a component that fetches and manages patient information and allows the user to edit and submit the form.
