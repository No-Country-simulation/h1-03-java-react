Sure, here's a structured and organized breakdown of the `EditMyInfoDoctors` component:

## Imports
- React functional component
- `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React
- `useQuery` hook from React Query
- `useSelector` hook from React Redux
- `endpoints` object from an external file
- `i18n` object from an external file
- `getFormEntries` function from an external file
- `alert` function from the global scope

## Component Definition
- The `EditMyInfoDoctors` component is defined as a functional component using the arrow function syntax.

## State Variables
- `entriesData` and `setEntriesData` are state variables that store the form data.
- `isPostInsteadOfPut` and `setIsPostInsteadOfPut` are state variables that store a boolean value indicating whether a POST or PUT request should be made.
- `language` is a state variable that stores the current language from the Redux store.

## Fetching Data
- The component uses the `useQuery` hook from React Query to fetch data from two different endpoints.
- The first fetch is a GET request to `endpoints.getUserAndDoctorInfo`.
- The second fetch is a POST request to `endpoints.doctors`.
- The fetched data is stored in state variables using the `data` property of the `useQuery` hook.

## Error Handling
- If there is an error in the GET request, it is logged to the console.
- If there is an error in the POST or PUT request, it is logged to the console.

## Initial Form Loading
- The component uses the `useEffect` hook to handle the initial form loading.
- It fetches data from `endpoints.getUserAndDoctorInfo` and updates the form with the fetched data if certain conditions are met.
- If the conditions are met, `isPostInsteadOfPut` is set to `true`.
- If the conditions are not met, `isPostInsteadOfPut` is set to `false` and the form is populated with the fetched data.

## Form Submission
- The component defines a `handleSubmitDoctorForm` function that is called when the form is submitted.
- The function collects the form data using the `getFormEntries` function and stores it in the `entriesData` state variable.
- The component uses the `useEffect` hook to check if `entriesData` has been set.
- If it has, it either makes a POST or PUT request to `endpoints.doctors` based on the value of `isPostInsteadOfPut`.
- The response from the request is displayed in an alert.

## Rendering
- The component renders a form with input fields for telephone, address, and license, and a select field for specialty.
- The form is conditionally rendered based on whether the data has been fetched or not.
- The form is wrapped in a section with a class of `min-h-screen flex flex-col text-center`.
- The form is wrapped in a section with a class of `min-h-screen flex flex-col lg:flex-row justify-center items-start gap-8 p-10 mt-0`.
- The form is wrapped in a container component.
- The form is wrapped in a form component.
- The form is wrapped in a button component.
- The form is wrapped in a section with a class of `min-h-screen flex flex-col text-center`.
