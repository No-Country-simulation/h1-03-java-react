**Overview**

This is a React functional component named `Row`. It receives three props: `isButtonSchedule`, `isModificate`, and `data`. The component is responsible for rendering a row of data with buttons and handling conditional rendering based on the props and state variables.

**State and Props**

The component has two state variables: `modificate` and `entriesData`. These state variables are initialized using the `useState` hook.

The component also receives three props:

* `isButtonSchedule`: a boolean value that determines the rendering of a button
* `isModificate`: a boolean value that determines the rendering of a modify button
* `data`: an object that contains data to be rendered

**Data Fetching**

The component uses the `useQuery` hook from the `react-query` library to handle data fetching and caching. The `useQuery` hook is configured with an object that includes the query key, query function, and enabled flag.

**Event Handling**

The component defines an `onClickHandlerSchedule` function that is called when a button is clicked. This function creates an object `objToSend` with the `id` property from the `data` prop and sets it as the value of `entriesData` using the `setEntriesData` function.

**Side Effects**

The component uses the `useEffect` hook to perform some side effects when the `entriesData` state variable changes. Inside the `useEffect` hook, it checks if `entriesData` is truthy and then calls the `refetchPostScheduleAppointment` function. The result of the refetch is handled in a promise chain, where it displays an alert based on the response data.

**Rendering**

The component returns JSX code that renders a `<div>` element with a nested structure of `<div>` elements. The structure and content of the rendered elements depend on the values of the props and state variables. The JSX code also includes conditional rendering based on the `isButtonSchedule` and `modificate` props.
