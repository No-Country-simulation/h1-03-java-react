Sure, here's an organized and clear explanation of the code snippet:

## Function `getTomorrowDate()`

This JavaScript function is designed to return the date of tomorrow in ISO string format.

### Steps

1. The function starts by creating a new `Date` object named `today` which represents the current date and time.

2. Next, a new `Date` object named `tomorrow` is created, initialized with the value of `today`.

3. The `setDate()` method is called on `tomorrow` to add one day to it. This effectively sets `tomorrow` to the date of the next day.

4. The `toISOString()` method is called on `tomorrow` to convert it to an ISO string representation.

5. The resulting ISO string is then split into two parts using the dot (`.`) as the separator.

6. The first part of the split string, which represents the date portion of the ISO string, is returned by the function.

### Output

The function returns the date of tomorrow in ISO string format, excluding the milliseconds part. For example, if the function is called on a date of October 1, 2022, it will return the string `"2022-10-02T00:00:00.000Z"`.
