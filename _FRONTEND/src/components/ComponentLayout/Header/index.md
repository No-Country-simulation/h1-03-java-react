## Overview

This code defines a React functional component called `Header`. It is a part of a larger application that uses React and Redux.

## State Management

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of `isMobileScreen`. The initial value of `isMobileScreen` is set to `false`. The `setIsMobileScreen` function is used to update the value of `isMobileScreen`.

The component also uses the `useSelector` hook to select values from the Redux store. It selects the `headerHeightValue` and `isActiveHamburgerButton` values from the `headerReducer` in the Redux store.

## Responsive Design

The component uses the `window.innerWidth` property to determine if the screen is a mobile screen. If the window width is greater than or equal to 1280, `isMobileScreen` is set to `false`, otherwise it is set to `true`.

The `setterIsMobileState` function is used to update the value of `isMobileScreen` based on the window width.

The `window.onresize` event is used to call the `setterIsMobileState` function whenever the window is resized.

## Lifecycle Methods

The component uses the `useEffect` hook to call the `setterIsMobileState` function once when the component is mounted.

## Rendering

The component renders a `header` element with a class name of "header". The height of the header is set based on the `headerHeightValue` value.

The component conditionally renders either the `MobileNav` or `Nav` component based on the value of `isMobileScreen`.

## Conclusion

This code snippet is a functional component in a React application. It manages state using the `useState` hook and selects values from the Redux store using the `useSelector` hook. It uses responsive design to determine the value of `isMobileScreen` based on the window width. The component renders a `header` element with conditional rendering of either the `MobileNav` or `Nav` component.
