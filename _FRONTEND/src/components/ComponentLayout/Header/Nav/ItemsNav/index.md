**ItemsNav Component Overview**

**Introduction**
The `ItemsNav` component is a React functional component that displays a dynamic navigation menu based on the user's language and role.

**Hooks Used**
- `useSelector`: Retrieves the user's language and role from the Redux store.
- `useNavigate`: Navigates to different routes.
- `useDispatch`: Dispatches actions to the Redux store.
- `useQuery`: Fetches data from an API to check the user's role and token.

**Variables**
- `itemsNav`: An array of navigation items based on the user's language and role.
- `url` and `token`: Used to fetch data from the API.
- `handleClick`: A function that handles clicks on navigation items.

**useEffect Hooks**
- The first `useEffect` hook updates the navigation items when the user's role changes.
- The second `useEffect` hook refetches data from the API when the user's role is null and a token is present.

**Return Statement**
The component returns a list of navigation items, where each item is a `li` element with an `onClick` event handler that calls the `handleClick` function.

**Conclusion**
The `ItemsNav` component is responsible for displaying a dynamic navigation menu based on the user's language and role, and for handling clicks on navigation items to navigate to different routes.
